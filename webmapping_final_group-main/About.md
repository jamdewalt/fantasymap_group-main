### About Atlantis
The world of Atlantis runs on Stellvite, a type of metal not found on Earth. Think of it like Vibranium from Black Panther. The people of Atlantis use it to create technology that borders on magical. Because of Stellvite, the people of Atlantis never became reliant on coal, gas, etc. Although Stellvite helped create advanced technology, there was no industrial revolution like there was on earth. This world has a steampunk/1800s/fantasy feel.

### Stellvite
Stellvite is both malleable and indestructible. In its natural form it is soft, so it can be shaped into whatever you want. Once it is heated by fire, it becomes indestructible.Because it is so malleable, Stellvite is often found mixed with other metals like nickel, copper, iron, gold, silver. These different mixtures are used for different purposes. Pure Stellvite is rare. Stellvite is often found in the presence of a poisonous gas, so it has to be mined/extracted carefully.

 ### World History
1. Before the Drangjörd Empire:
The continent of Atlantis was made up of hundreds of small kingdoms. The Drangrian people, from Drangjörd (current day Norskena and the northwest part of the Kingdom of Vynter), were seafaring traders, warriors, and explorers (inspired by vikings).The Drangrians were the first people to discover and use Stellvite. Once their meager supply ran out, they started searching the world for more. Over the course of a century—a period of time called the Blood Age—the Drangrian people expanded throughout and eventually conquered all of Atlantis. 
    
2. The Drangjörd Empire:
Once they conquered Atlantis, the Drangrian people called this world the Drangjörd Empire.The ten most powerful Jarl families banded together. They split the world into ten territories, each one ruled by one of the families: Falk, Thundersen, Folsberg, Vynter, Estergard, Allstrom, Jorgonsen, Strand, Holt, Westgard. Each family received a seat on the High Council, which ruled the empire as a whole. Council members voted on a Chieftain who ran council meetings and broke tie votes. Chieftains were appointed for life and were the most respected members of society. Once a Chieftain was appointed, his family was allowed to select another person to fill their council member seat. There were eleven seats on the High Council in total. 

3. During the Great Spitting
Atlantica, the capital of the Drangrjörd empire, was built over the biggest vein of Stellvite. Stellvite ran out almost everywhere except for Atlantica.  
Demand grew so high that they were practicing unsafe mining techniques in an attempt to get the stellvite out faster. These unsafe mining techniques lead to an explosion that destroyed the city of Atlantica. Prior to the explosion, four of the ten noble families (Allstrom, Strand, Holt and Folsberg) used the remaining stellvite to open a portal and escape to earth to save themselves. 


4. After the Great Splitting
After four of the noble families fled to earth and Atlantica (now called the Sunken City) was destroyed, the Drangjörd Empire split into seven sovereign states: the New Drangjörd Empire, the Kingdom of Vynter, the Elderon Islands, Norskena, Glasdraíoch, the Republic of Velesar and The Western Isle. This was called the Great Splitting. The New Drangjörd Empire is rule by the Jorgonsen family with an empress (monarchy). The Kingdom of Vynter is ruled by the Vynter family with a king (monarchy). As a result of the explosion that sank Atlantica, a large portion of the Vynter family was killed. Their greatest ally, the Thundersen family, was completely wiped out. Because of this, the Kingdom of Vynter took up a crusade against stellvite and anyone that used stellvite. Not only did they ban stellvite from being used in the Kingdom of Vynter, but they set out to kill any remaining family members of the four families that fled (Allstrom, Strand, Holt and Folsberg). Glasdraíoch is ruled by a priestess who is the spokesperson for their goddess, the Lady of Mist (theocracy)The island was originally controlled by the Estergard family, but the native people of the island rebelled after the Great Splitting. They overthrew and killed off the Estergard family (rumored to be sacrificed to their goddess). Norskena is ruled by the Falk family with a king (monarchy).The Elderon Islands are ruled by a king (monarchy).The Allstrom family controlled this territory before fleeing to Earth. The royal family that sprang up in their absence is actually an offshoot of the Allstrom family who changed their names to escape the Kingdom of Vynter’s assassins. The people of the Elderon Islands helped hide the Allstrom family. Unlike the Estergard family who ruled Glasdraíoch with an iron fist, the Allstrom family integrated with the people of the territory they controlled. They married them, took up their religion and customs, and always made decisions based on the good of the people. The Western Isle is ruled by the Westgard family through their control of the army and navy (military dictatorship). The Republic of Velesar is ruled by chancellor who is elected by the people every five years (republic).The Holt family originally controlled this territory before they fled to Earth. Because of the mountain barrier and the dangerous sea, it was hard for one of the remaining noble families to take control of the territory after the Great Splitting. During the great splitting, the New Drangjörd Empire used the chaos to claim Soul’s Gate (the island located in the sea between the Elderon Islands, the New Drangjörd Empire, and the Western Isle), a resource-rich island that was part of the Elderon Islands chain. The island was considered a sacred place to the people of the Elderon Islands and was used for religious ceremonies, but they did not have the military power to defend their own territory. However, the Western Isle did not like the idea of the New Drangjörd Empire taking control of the land. The two families fought over who got to claim that territory. Finally, they came to an agreement (though no one was really happy about this agreement) that no one gets that land. Both the Westgard and Drangjörd naval fleets guard the waters around the island to make sure that neither is using it for their own advantage. However, the Drangjörd Empire discovers an old Stellvite railroad system built under the water that connects to the island, and they start secretly mining the resources on the island. Eventually, the Westgard family finds out and they decide to sail to the island and start taking resources themselves. There is a fight between the naval fleets and Roman’s older brother and the heir to the Westgard family is killed. This causes major tension and both the Drangjörd Empire and Western Isle start preparing for war.

 ### Religion in Atlantis
1. The Ancient Elements
A totemism religion practiced in the old kingdoms of the Drangrian people before they conquered Atlantis where the people have a mystical relationship with the elements (Earth, Water, Air, and Fire), which are considered sacred. Worshipers of the Ancient Elements do not have elaborate ceremonies, holy texts, hierarchies of priests, or large structures of worship like followers of the Grace of Eight or the Church of Lady Mist. Instead they build small, simple shrines to the element of their choosing where they pray, ask the elements for favors, and leave gifts/offerings. When the Drangrian people conquered Atlantis, they brought their religion with them. Over time, their religious practices mixed/mingled with the main polytheism religion practiced by the rest of the continent, resulting in the Grace of Eight. Although this new religion became the dominant religion for most of the empire, the Ancient Elements are still worshiped by Norskena and the Kingdom of Vynter in the north.

2. The Church of Lady Mist
A monotheistic religion practiced in Glasdraíoch. Even though the Church of Lady Mist is monotheistic, it is loosely based on Gaelic paganism and Irish mythology.The clergy is made up of priestesses and governed by a high priestess. Lady Mist, also known as the Lady of Mist or Ríona Ceo (meaning queenly mist in Gaelic), came to Atlantis from the Otherworld and created mankind. When a person dies, they are put to rest in a family burial mound. These burial mounds are passages to the Otherworld. If you were a good person, Lady Mist allows you to live in the Otherworld for eternity. If you were a bad person, you are barred from the Otherworld and your spirit is left to roam the world endlessly.  


3. The Grace of Eight
A polytheism religion commonly referred to as “the Eight” that is practiced in the New Drangian Empire and the Western Isle.
They worship the “Eight True Gods”. The God of Death, the Goddess of Life, the God of Love, the Goddess of War, the God of the Sea, the Goddess of the Land , the God of the Sun, and the Goddess of the Moon. When the Drangrian people conquered Atlantis, they brought their religion with them. Over time, their religious practices mixed/mingled with the main polytheism religion practiced by the rest of the continent, resulting in the Grace of Eight. Although this new religion became the dominant religion for most of the empire, the Ancient Elements are still worshiped in the north. “May the Eight grace you.”

4. Usmanism 
Monotheistic religion that worships the God Usman. Usman is the only God and known as the creator of life.  Origin: “Usman” name in Arabic meaning “the chosen one”. This religion is practiced in the republic of Velesar. 


5. Mounyama: 
A monotheistic religion (based on a hybrid of Afro-Caribbean religions). This religion is practiced in the Elderon Islands
