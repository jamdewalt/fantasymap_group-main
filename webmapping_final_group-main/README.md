### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. Persona:The following scenarios describe the use of the Fantasy Mapper by a reader of the book, which we have found is the target reader profile for the book and therefore the user profile for the map. Our hypothetical reader is a fan of fantasy books and many of the worlds created by those books so has a general understanding of fantasy settings. This reader as well does post on book review sites and wants to give the best review of the book possible. Her goal is to be able explore the world of Atlantis and gain a better understanding of the world. In using the map, the primary goal of the user is to **associate** the story in the book with places on the map. The user **goal** is to gather more information about the places **associated** with the books events. Beyond that the other motivation for using the interactive map would be to learn more about the setting. The user lacks the ability to **compare** different locations in the setting and discover **trends and patterns** within the region when just using the map in the book. This undermines their ability to **identify** parts of the world of Atlantis.

2. User Case Scenarios
    1. Scenario 1: Upon arriving at the interactive, the user is met with a visual of the map of Atlantis. The user has four main options upon opening the map, pan, zoom, retrieve, or search for a location on the map. The user is interested in learning more about "The Republic of Velesar" and the area surrounding it so they zoom to that corner of the map. From there the user pans across the area and clicks on different buildings, cities, and locations **identifying** them by their names and **associating** them with what they read in the book. While exploring the area the user clicks on the city of Zarthos in order to retrieve information about the city and its relation to the story. A pop up explaining Zarthos's significance to the story and the actions that took place here enters the screen allowing the user to **associate** what they read to what they can see on the map and where every action took place. The user then pans to the nearby city of Jasrabad and **comparing** it to Zarthos, looks for similarities and differences between the two and what took place at each city. After learning all they can and being able to visualize what they read the user logs off the map. 
    2. Scenario 2: Upon arriving at the interactive, the user is met with a visual of the map of Atlantis. The user has four main options upon opening the map, pan, zoom, retrieve, or search for a location on the map. This user is interested in the actions that took place within The Great Northern Wood so they move to the searchbar and type in Skograheim, the city within the forests. Upon entering the name the users screen pans and zooms to the city and a pop up provides information and visuals to the user. With this the user is able to **compare** their ideas of what Skograheim looked like to it's portrayed appearance on the map. Knowing where Skograheim now lies the user now builds an **association** between Skograheim and the Great Northern Wood and their location within The Kingdom of Vynter. Curious now about the Kingdom of Vynter and more about what took place here within the story. The user pans to the Jarnmerki Mountains to learn more about how treacherous the path through them is and **identifying** the road that the main characters travelled on through those dangerous cliffs and valleys. After learning more about the cities and areas to the north within the story, the user logs off the map.

3.Requirements Document:

    Representation
    1.Basemap: Five multiscale tilesets for use as the basemap including: Political, Physical, Topographical, Roads, and Climate. Priority in that order
    2.Legend: Visual description of capital cities, cities, towns, routes, and other Places of Interest(POIs)
    3.Supp. Information: Documentation on map sources and techniques, along with notes from the authors
    4.Scale Bar: Provides a visual indication of distance and feature size on the map, may be a fictious unit of measurement 
    5.Routes: Depicted by various types of colored/weighted lines based on overall hierarchy of roads
    6.Population Centers: Depicted by a visual/symbolic hierarchy pertaining to overall population size in the pop center
    7.Places of Interest: Notable landmarks/POIs from the book depicted with an representative icon
    8.Overview: Documentation on background description and provides some guidance to using the map

    Interaction
    1.Basemap Toggle: Overlay: Switch between Basemaps
    2.Population Center Selection: Retrieve: Objects. Hover to highlight population center. Click to provide more lore/information, to include .jpg file of pop center structures map
    3.Route Selection: Retrieve: Objects. Hover to highlight route selection. Click to provide more lore/information on route
    4.Place of Interest Selection: Retrieve: Objects. Hover to highlight POI selection. Click to provide more lore/information on POI
    5.Query Panel: Search. Objects. Form-fill in to search for specific pop centers, routes, or POIs. Highlight and pan to selection. Utilizes text-autofill to avoid losing interest from not knowing proper spelling
    6.Map Browsing: Zoom/Pan. Zoom slider/Zoom buttons: Direct Manipulation by double clicking on Map and +/- control.  Pan buttons:Direct Manipulation for pan via click and drag, potentially implement a button that resets to a set base view
    7. Help/Supp.Info: Retrieve: Objects. Direct manipulation by clicking to open Supp.Info/ help documentation

4. Wireframes
Lo-fi Wireframes
Finally, provide a series of low-fidelity wireframes that walk through your use case scenario and that demonstrate the layout of your proposed functionality. A separate wireframe must be created for every new view generated in the use case scenario (i.e., for every interaction, or every click). The low-fidelity wireframes should be raw hand-drawn sketches for the draft, but more thoughtfully prepared designs for the final (e.g., use a ruler for straight edges, different colored markers for annotation). Please annotate all interactive functionality in the first wireframe using the terminology from the requirements document. All wireframes should be submitted as high quality scans.

Your draft and final proposals are submitted as a readme file in a collaborative Github repo one hour before lab the week of the deadline, with a PDF print backup submitted to Canvas. The readme eventually will replace your "about" content for your interactive web map.
