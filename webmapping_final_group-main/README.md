### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. Persona: This potential audience for this project are readers or potential readers that wish to explore the world of Atlantis more. Their primary motivation for using this project is to learn more about the setting. Therefore, we predict user motivation for using this project will primarily be out of their own interest. User expertise level in using the project varies, therefore, we need to make sure the UI/UIX is applicable to people of varying expertise. To account for lack of experience, we will implement affordances that will help the user understand the interface. 
    2. Scenario: This project primarily supports the presentation stage of science. The user, a reader of the book would be examining and exploring the map of the world and finding out where a speccific event in the book occured. They want to be able to pan, and zoom in order to be able to explore the map and find the location they were looking for. They also wish to receive infomation about the place they decided to look for by clicking on the location. Being able to add layers and gain more information about the place would also be informative for them.   Additionally, we can use overlays to present different layers of information.

2. User Case Scenarios
    1. Scenario 1: Upon arriving at the interactive, the user is met with a visual of the map of Atlantis. The user has four main options upon opening the map, pan, zoom, retrieve, or search for a location on the map. The user is interested in learning more about "The Republic of Velesar" and the area surrounding it so they zoom to that corner of the map. From there the user pans across the area and clicks on different buildings, cities, and locations **identifying** them by their names and **associating** them with what they read in the book. While exploring the area the user clicks on the city of Zarthos in order to retrieve information about the city and its relation to the story. A pop up explaining Zarthos's significance to the story and the actions that took place here enters the screen allowing the user to **associate** what they read to what they can see on the map and where every action took place. The user then pans to the nearby city of Jasrabad and **comparing** it to Zarthos, looks for similarities and differences between the two and what took place at each city. After learning all they can and being able to visualize what they read the user logs off the map. 
    2. Scenario 2: Upon arriving at the interactive, the user is met with a visual of the map of Atlantis. The user has four main options upon opening the map, pan, zoom, retrieve, or search for a location on the map. This user is interested in the actions that took place within The Great Northern Wood so they move to the searchbar and type in Skograheim, the city within the forests. Upon entering the name the users screen pans and zooms to the city and a pop up provides information and visuals to the user. With this the user is able to **compare** their ideas of what Skograheim looked like to it's portrayed appearance on the map. Knowing where Skograheim now lies the user now builds an **association** between Skograheim and the Great Northern Wood and their location within The Kingdom of Vynter. Curious now about the Kingdom of Vynter and more about what took place here within the story. The user pans to the Jarnmerki Mountains to learn more about how treacherous the path through them is and **identifying** the road that the main characters travelled on through those dangerous cliffs and valleys. After learning more about the cities and areas to the north within the story, the user logs off the map.

4. Wireframes
Lo-fi Wireframes
Finally, provide a series of low-fidelity wireframes that walk through your use case scenario and that demonstrate the layout of your proposed functionality. A separate wireframe must be created for every new view generated in the use case scenario (i.e., for every interaction, or every click). The low-fidelity wireframes should be raw hand-drawn sketches for the draft, but more thoughtfully prepared designs for the final (e.g., use a ruler for straight edges, different colored markers for annotation). Please annotate all interactive functionality in the first wireframe using the terminology from the requirements document. All wireframes should be submitted as high quality scans.

Your draft and final proposals are submitted as a readme file in a collaborative Github repo one hour before lab the week of the deadline, with a PDF print backup submitted to Canvas. The readme eventually will replace your "about" content for your interactive web map.
