### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. Persona:The following scenarios describe the use of the Fantasy Mapper by a reader of the book, which we have found is the target reader profile for the book and therefore the user profile for the map. Our hypothetical reader is a fan of fantasy books and many of the worlds created by those books so has a general understanding of fantasy settings. This reader as well does post on book review sites and wants to give the best review of the book possible. Her goal is to be able explore the world of Atlantis and gain a better understanding of the world. In using the map, the primary goal of the user is to **associate** the story in the book with places on the map. The user **goal** is to gather more information about the places **associated** with the books events. Beyond that the other motivation for using the interactive map would be to learn more about the setting. The user lacks the ability to **compare** different locations in the setting and discover **trends and patterns** within the region when just using the map in the book. This undermines their ability to **identify** parts of the world of Atlantis.

2. User Case Scenarios
    1. Scenario 1: Upon arriving at the interactive, the user is met with a visual of the map of Atlantis. The user has four main options upon opening the map, pan, zoom, retrieve, or search for a location on the map. The user is interested in learning more about "Norskena" and the area surrounding it so they zoom to that corner of the map. From there the user pans across the area and clicks on different buildings, cities, and locations **identifying** them by their names and **associating** them with what they read in the book. While exploring the area the user clicks on the city of Dypvik in order to retrieve information about the city and its relation to the story. A pop up explaining Dypvik's significance to the story and the actions that took place here enters the screen allowing the user to **associate** what they read to what they can see on the map and where every action took place. The user then pans to the nearby city of Veka and **comparing** it to Dypvik, looks for similarities and differences between the two and what took place at each city. After learning all they can and being able to visualize what they read the user logs off the map. 
    2. Scenario 2: Upon arriving at the interactive, the user is met with a visual of the map of Atlantis. The user has four main options upon opening the map, pan, zoom, retrieve, or search for a location on the map. This user is interested in the actions that took place within The Great Northern Wood so they move to the searchbar and type in Skograheim, the city within the forests. Upon entering the name the users screen pans and zooms to the city and a pop up provides information and visuals to the user. With this the user is able to **compare** their ideas of what Skograheim looked like to it's portrayed appearance on the map. Knowing where Skograheim now lies the user now builds an **association** between Skograheim and the Great Northern Wood and their location within The Kingdom of Vynter. Curious now about the Kingdom of Vynter and more about what took place here within the story. The user pans to the Jarnmerki Mountains to learn more about how treacherous the path through them is and **identifying** the road that the main characters travelled on through those dangerous cliffs and valleys. After learning more about the cities and areas to the north within the story, the user logs off the map.
